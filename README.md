# Share-My-Place-App
In this project, we have used the google map APIs to get the location of user or his address entered manually and printed it on the google maps and shared it.


# How to run this ?

1- Get a Google Map Javascript API by creating an account.

2- Create the server by the serve keyword. You will get a temporary localhost:5000 link. Open it in your browser. That will run your index.html file

3- You need to allow the server to get your location for this.
